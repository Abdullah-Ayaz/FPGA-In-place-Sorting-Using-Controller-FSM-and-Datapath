# FPGA-In-place-Sorting-Using-Controller-FSM-and-Datapath
This project focuses on the concept of in-place sorting of array elements in RAM. The project uses FSM logic to generate signals for the controller that guide the memory operations in the Datapath. At the end, we receive the  sorted array in memory with the smallest number as the first element and the largest number as the last element.
